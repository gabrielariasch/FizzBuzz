# FizzBuzz

This code is a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz programming challenge. The challenge is to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but with the following substitutions:

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead.
The code above uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100. Inside the for loop, an if statement is used to check if the current number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the code prints "FizzBuzz". If the number is divisible by only 3, the code prints "Fizz". If the number is divisible by only 5, the code prints "Buzz". Otherwise, the code simply prints the number.

This code is a simple way to implement the FizzBuzz programming challenge. You can modify the code to print different messages for numbers that are divisible by different numbers.
